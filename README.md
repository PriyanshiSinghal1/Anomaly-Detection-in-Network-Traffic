# Anomaly-Detection-in-Network-Traffic

Welcome to the Celebal Celebal Technologies Data Science Final Project repository!The aim of this project is to detect unusual patterns or anomalies in network traffic data, which could indicate potential security breaches or system malfunctions. Two approaches are used for anomaly detection:

  i) Isolation Forest
  ii) Autoencoder


  
Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of network traffic data. It includes the following files:

  • train.csv: Training data with network traffic information and anomaly labels.

  • test.csv: Test data for evaluating the models.

  • Submission.csv: Template for submission of anomaly detection results.
